            <p>
                Marketec for PC is a business tool for offline and cloud-synced data management. We handle data as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We collect <strong>Company Name</strong> (required), and optionally <strong>User Name</strong> and <strong>Email Address</strong>. This information is used only for license registration, 45-day trial authentication, and technical support.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Data:</strong> Your invoices, stock, and sales data are stored locally on your device. Full license users may choose to store information online for cloud synchronization and license verification.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Backups:</strong> You may voluntarily send database backups to our server for support purposes; we do not request or automatically collect backups.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Location Data:</strong> The PC application <strong>does not</strong> access, collect, or transmit your device’s geographical location.
            </p>
            <p>No other personal data is collected or shared with third parties.</p>

            <h2>Marketec Lookup (Android App)</h2>
            <p>
                The Marketec Android app collects the following information to provide its core features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> We collect <strong>Approximate and Precise Location</strong> to enable salesman check-in verification and route tracking. Location is only collected while the app is in use (Foreground) and is optional. You can deny location access at any time; core features will still work without it. Permissions requested: ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION.</li>
                <li><strong>User IDs:</strong> Account IDs and email addresses are collected for account management and license authentication.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> We may collect device IDs for app functionality, security, and preventing misuse.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Data Security:</strong> All data is encrypted in transit using secure protocols. Location and personal information are <strong>never shared with third-party advertisers</strong> or external services.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Data Retention:</strong> Location data is retained only as long as needed for check-in and route tracking and is automatically deleted afterward.
